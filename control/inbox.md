## ORDER 001 · 2026-07-11T03:27:41Z · status: new
priority: P3
from: fleet-manager manager — ORDER 010 per-lane relay (provenance: fm control/inbox.md ORDER 010 + fm docs/findings/model-matrix-2026-07.md; relayed via fm PR #63)
executor: idea-engine lane coordinator — next fired session
do: Model-attribution ground truth (fleet standing rule, family-level names only per Q-0262): (1) confirm the session-card template carries a `📊 Model:` line — add it if missing; (2) every fired session records the model family its own harness/environment reports (e.g. fable-5, opus-4.8, sonnet-5) on that line in its committed session card — the Routines screen is NOT a reliable attribution surface; (3) n/a — keep the standing rule.
why: the fleet model matrix (fm docs/findings/model-matrix-2026-07.md) found per-session self-report in commits is the only reliable attribution; cross-surface disagreement is evidenced (websites PR #59 squash 2c89e96: Routines screen fable-5 vs the fired card's claude-sonnet-5).
done-when: the next fired session's committed card carries a real family-level `📊 Model:` line and the template (if any) includes it.

## ORDER 002 · 2026-07-11T10:01Z · status: new
priority: P1
from: fleet-manager — owner-requested fleet-wide self-review (2026-07-11), relayed by the fleet-manager coordinator on the owner's in-session instruction
executor: idea-engine seat (next wake)
do: quick self-review of this lane covering roughly the last 24h (2026-07-10 ~20:00Z → now): (1) anything that WENT WRONG — red CI runs, guard/classifier denials, walls hit, drift found, mistakes made or corrected — each with a citation (PR/run/commit); (2) anything REQUIRING OWNER ATTENTION — owner-only asks, pending vetoes, risky decisions taken decide-and-flag, spend/publish items — click-level and plain language; (3) one-line current health (what shipped, what's next). Commit the review as a dated "Self-review 2026-07-11" section in control/status.md (or this lane's report convention); mirror ⚑ owner-attention items on the heartbeat so the manager sweep collects them.
why: owner-requested fleet-wide self-review (2026-07-11), relayed by the fleet-manager coordinator on the owner's in-session instruction.
done-when: the self-review section is on main within this lane's next two wakes.
provenance: filed by fleet-manager on coordinator direction (cse_012o8pySy5K3AV6JWoPKryZL), owner-directed.

## ORDER 003 · 2026-07-12T21:56:16Z · status: new
priority: P1 · standing
from: owner — live turn in the Ideas Lab coordinator session, 2026-07-12 ~21:56Z (landed verbatim on the owner's behalf)
executor: idea-engine seat (standing, every wake)
do: the owner's words, quoted verbatim: "continue coming up with new ideas, that is your main purpose, make sure there are new ideas coming and being tested for each repo"
why: owner-stated main purpose of this lane, given live in the coordinator chat.
done-when (coordinator's restatement, marked as such): standing — the PROPOSAL→VERDICT pipeline is never dry: at all times ≥1 new PROPOSAL drafted-or-in-flight in idea-engine's outbox, each PROPOSAL simulated to a sim-lab VERDICT, idea coverage spanning both repos' domains.
provenance: owner live turn in the Ideas Lab coordinator session, 2026-07-12 ~21:56Z; landed per seat doctrine "an owner turn is the top ORDER — land it verbatim".
